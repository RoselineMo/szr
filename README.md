#Introduction

This web app provides a free url shortening service.

Along with the service is url customisation.
Additional functionalities are a QR Code generator and Analytics to track links performance.

#Setbacks
Currently, only the url shortening functionality is available. This is due to limitations of API availability & documentations, error struggles especially with Firebase and API and gaps in understanding. It is still a work in progress though. Hopefully will be completed and fully functional eventually.
